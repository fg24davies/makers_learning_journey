what is a feature test?

bike.working?
  if true
    docking station.release_bike
  end
return bike

what is the stack trace?
my understanding of a stack trace is the traceback - how the program is run and then where the error can be found 


Snapshot of my IRB:

floradavies@Floras-MacBook-Air makers_learning_journey % irb
3.0.0 :001 > docking_station = DockingStation.new

# Databases - Domain Modelling using CRC Cards

Class Responsibility Collaborator cards are one approach to modelling a domain.  See this [example](crc_example.md).

## Learning objectives

An exercise to learn three things:

1. Explain how to use CRC cards to model a domain
2. Model a simple domain using CRC cards
3. Infer database structure from domain structure

## Instructions

Following are some user stories.

### Use CRC cards to model the domain (20 mins)

Using [CRC cards](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm), model the domain in an Object-Oriented way.

### Create a database structure for the domain model (20 mins)

Draw out the structure of the database for the model you have built, in the following way (the example is a possible implementation of a `cohorts` table):

```
Table: cohorts

|  id  |     name     |
|---------------------|
|  1   |  "May 2016"  |
```

> You will probably need to use foreign keys and associations. There may be one or more 'join' tables involved too, in order to implement many-to-many relationships.

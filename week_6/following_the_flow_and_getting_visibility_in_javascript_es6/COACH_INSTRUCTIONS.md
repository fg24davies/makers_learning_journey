# Following the flow and getting visibility in JavaScript

## Learning objectives

At a high level, this week is about building the skills that let you learn a new language and its patterns.  In this workshop, you'll practice a bunch of different ways of following the flow and getting visibility in JavaScript.

## Starter (10 minutes)

* Talk about the high level goal of the week (see the [student README](README.md)).

* Demonstrate each of the following the flow and getting visibility techniques as you debug the FizzBuzz program.  Don't fix too much of it.

## Main (30 minutes)

See the [student readme](README.md) for instructions.

## Plenary (15 minutes)

* Ask about whether it was hard to apply new techniques when focusing on a bug.

* Ask about ways students keep track of new processes and techniques until they have a chance to try them about.  (Maybe talk about the [Ready Position](http://sjmog.github.io/posts/491_learning_to_learn_1/).)

* Ask about how the students learnt debugging techniques they already knew.

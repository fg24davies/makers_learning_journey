# Makers Learning Journey

This will include work from my self-directed learning in each week.
There is a weekly folder which will include folders for the weekly goals. 
This won't include the afternoon challenges but might reference them to show evidence for the goals. 
Some goals might only include a short README.md file, where I have small examples of code or notes.
Other goals will have folders to evidence work e.g debugging and tdd workshops.
